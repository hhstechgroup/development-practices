## EDM
The concepts of an EDM are abstract ideas of entities (objects or nodes) and associations (relationships), constructed by properties. The 3 key concepts are:
- Entity types: Specific node objects that are top-level nouns (e.g., patients, encounters, providers, insurances, diagnoses)
- Associations: connecting one entity type to another
- Property types: define structure and characteristics of entity and association types.

## OData
Allows to create queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs. Compared to GraphQL but better.

OData can be used to access table like structures much the same way ODBC does.

Entity Data Model (EDM) used to describe OData Services. EDM modeling tools available to model OData Services:
- Each entity can support Create,  Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
- Can navigate relationships
- Complex Types supported

**URI Components**

REST OData protocol supports aggregation, sorting, pagination, change sets (transactions), etc.
